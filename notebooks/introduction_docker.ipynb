    "[Docker](https://www.docker.com) is an open-source project that automates the deployment of applications inside software containers. Those containers wrap up a piece of software in a complete filesystem that contains everything it needs to run: code, system tools, software libraries, such as Python, FSL, AFNI, SPM, FreeSurfer, ANTs, etc. This guarantees that it will always run the same, regardless of the environment it is running in.\n",

For more information on how to do this see the [Nipype website](resources_installation.ipynb). But for Windows users, or users that don't want to set up all the dependencies themselves, Docker is the way to go."

Here: ``/path/to/nipype_tutorial`` is your local directory where you downloaded [Nipype Tutorial repository](https://github.com/miykael/nipype_tutorial/). ``/path/to/data/`` is a directory where you have dataset [``ds000114``](https://openfmri.org/dataset/ds000114/), and ``/path/to/output`` can be an empty directory that will be used for output. The second part of the ``-v`` flag (here: ``/home/neuro/nipype_tutorial``, ``/data`` or ``/output``) specifies under which path the mounted folders can be found inside the container. **Important**: To use the ``tutorial``, ``data`` and ``output`` folder, you first need to create them on your system!\n",
